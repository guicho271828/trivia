+ news! new pattern: lambda-list pattern. Contributed by akssri
+ news! new pattern: number-related patterns, e.g. >, <, =, <= ... 
+ news! Inline pattern implemented ! : @, @@ ...
+ news!(04/02/2016) Support for fare-quasiquote is now available. See =test/quasiquote= for the usage
+ news!(04/22/2016) Added metabang-bind like macros =if-match=, =when-match=, =unless-match=, =let-match=, =let*-match=, =let-match1=
+ news!(05/21/2016) Added support for minor implementations: CMU, ECL, CLISP, ABCL.
+ news!(05/22/2016) Implemented =ARRAY=, =SIMPLE-ARRAY=, =ARRAY-ROW-MAJOR=, =ARRAY-ROW-MAJOR*= patterns! Multi-dimentional arrays are now more handy!
+ news!(07/21/2016) Added =READ=, =LAST=, =SPLIT=, =SPLIT*= patterns! Parsing the string is more conveninent.
+ news!(01/21/2017) Added =DYNAMIC= pattern! Careful use of this pattern can impact the performance sensitive code.
+ news!(04/08/2017) Added a new contrib package =TRIVIA.CFFI= which provides =->= pattern ! Offers convenient access to foreign objects.
+ news!(05/26/2018) Added =property!=, which only matches when the key is present in a plist.
+ news!(09/06/2018) SPLIT symbol was exported from the =trivia.ppcre= package.
+ news!(02/19/2019) Added =MEMBER= pattern. When the argument is a constant, it also adds type declaration.
+ news!(04/24/2019) Improved the compilation of =GUARD= pattern. It no longer uses the internal hackery.
+ news!(04/24/2019) Balland2006 optimizer is now the default optimizer for the pattern compiler!
+ *news!(04/28/2019)* Added a =progv= pattern, which can dynamically alter the dynamic variable the value will be bound to.
+ *news!(05/08/2019)* Now the optimizer can be specified in the lexical environment via =(declare (trivia:optimizer <name>))= (e.g. =(declare (trivia:optimizer :trivial))=). Implemented through cltl2 API.
+ *news!(10/11/2019)* The OR1 consistency checking algorithm in Level 1 no longer takes the exponential runtime. Compilation of [[https://github.com/guicho271828/type-r][type-r]] library is now 10x faster! (patch from @pfdietz)
+ *news!(08/01/2020)* Due to the recent breakage in the original (and unmaintained) Optima library in SBCL, a compatibility layer was added.

* Trivia : Trivial Pattern Matching Compiler

Trivia is a pattern matching compiler that is *compatible with Optima*.
It shares the same testing code with Optima and acts as a
drop-in replacement for 99% usage. For the basic usage, consult [[https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia/wiki][our wiki]].
*Known differences between Optima and Trivia, which are bug, are [[https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia/wiki/Known-Differences][described here]] (7/31/2016)*

Patterns compiled with Trivia runs *[[https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia/wiki/Benchmarking-Results][faster than Optima]]*.

[1]: trivia is using :balland2006 optimiizer

... and Trivia is *more extensible*. In fact, Trivia's =defpattern= is able
to implement all of [[https://github.com/m2ym/optima#constructor-pattern][unmodifiable, core pattern language]] in Optima within itself.
