  "Constant-folds the argument.
The argument should be a compile-time constant such as 5, x, (2), #(1 2 3), #S(foo :a 1).
QUOTE pattern is a synonym for CONSTANT pattern. Thus (quote ...) is equivalent to (constant ...).

Elementary objects are compared by EQL. (characters, numbers, symbols)
Conses, structures, arrays are recursively decomposed element-wise in compile time.
Thus the comparison is different from either EQUAL or EQUALP:
EQUAL only descends into conses/strings/bitvec, and EQUALP uses case-insensitive comparison.

Pathnames are compared by EQUAL.
Hash-tables are compared by EQUALP, but this usage is not recommended and subject to change.
If it does not match any of the above types, it is compared by EQ.

When the given object is decomposed, each sub-object forms a pattern.
 (constant #(a _ 0)) matches #(2 1 0) where A is bound to 2.
 (constant #S(person :name (cons a b))) matches #S(person :name (\"Susan\" \"Calvin\")).
 (constant #S(person :name (a b))) errors, because pattern expander A is not defined.
This behavior is compatible to Optima.

However, this rule does not apply to conses, as the feature is instead supported by quasiquotes (see issue #86).
i.e., (constant (a b)) DOES NOT match '(1 0) and matches '(a b).


Examples:

  (constant x) matches a symbol 'x, not a variable x under the scope.
  (constant x) does not match a symbol 'y.
  (constant #\x) matches a character #\x, and not #\X. (-> eql)
  (constant 1) matches 1.

Sequences (cons,bitvec,vector,string):
  (constant (a b)) matches '(A B) and not '(1 0).
  (constant \"aaa\") matches \"aaa\".
  (constant #(0 1)) matches #(0 1).
  (constant #(_ _)) matches #(0 1).
  (constant #(A B)) matches #(0 1) with A bound to 1, B bound to 0.
Unlike EQUAL, fill-pointer is ignored (lengths should match).

Structures:
  (constant #(person :name \"Bob\")) matches #(person :name \"Bob\").
  (constant #(person :name \"Bob\")) does not match #(person :name \"bob\"). (-> case sensitive unlike EQUALP)
  (constant #(person :name a)) matches #(person :name \"Bob\"), with A bound to \"Bob\".

General Array:
  (constant #2A((0 1) (0 1))) matches #2A((0 1) (0 1)).    (-> similar to equalp)
  (constant #2A((#\a #\a))) does not match #2A((#\A #\A)). (-> case sensitive unlike EQUALP)
  (constant #2A((0 a) (b 1))) matches #2A((0 1) (0 1)) where A and B bound to 1 and 0.
